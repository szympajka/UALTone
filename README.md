## Medium
Medium is for me one of the best sources for research in terms of storytelling as is something between Stackoverflow (Q&A form) and Documentaton websites. It is just impossible and wastefull to print every single article I found usefull.

## Brand New - amazing hub for rebrandings
This is the same story as with Medium. Since I heard about it I have read dosents of articles and it improved my key skills for making branding and identity which taste good
